#### Installation steps

* Download the code from the repository [https://github.com/selvakumarEsra/abc](https://github.com/selvakumarEsra/abc)
* Copy the `simplycode` folder to `ghost dir/content/themes/` folder
* Change `disqus_shortname` variable in `partials/disqus.hbs` file to your disqus short name
* In the ghost Admin dashboard, goto Theme section and select simplycode theme

#### Compiling Sass

You can use Grunt and Node Sass. Just cd into theme folder and run ````npm install```` (with 'sudo' if you're on Ubuntu like linux) and then ````grunt```` to compile scss file and also 'watch for changes'.

You can see Gruntfile.js for configuration changes. You can also play with other Grunt tasks here.

Of course if you want you can still use Ruby version. Just go to assets folder and run ````scss --watch scss:css````

But I think that Libsass/Node version is much faster.
